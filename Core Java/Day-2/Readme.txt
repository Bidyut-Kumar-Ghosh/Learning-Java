# My Java Learning Journey  

Welcome to my repository! This is where I document my journey of learning Core Java. Each day, I'll be adding notes, code snippets, and reflections on what I've learned.  

## Day 2: Learning About Variables  

**Date:** August 20, 2024  

### Today's Focus  

Today, I focused on understanding variables in Java. Here are some key points I learned:  

1. **What is a Variable?**  
   - A variable is a container that holds data that can be changed during the execution of a program.  
   - It has a name, a data type, and a value.  

2. **Declaring Variables**  
   - In Java, you declare a variable by specifying its data type followed by the variable name.  
   - Example:  
     ```java  
     int age;  
     String name;  
     ```  

3. **Initializing Variables**  
   - Variables must be initialized (assigned a value) before they can be used.  
   - Example:  
     ```java  
     age = 25;  
     name = "John Doe";  
     ```  

4. **Data Types**  
   - Java has several built-in data types, including:  
     - **Primitive Types:** `int`, `char`, `boolean`, `double`, etc.  
     - **Reference Types:** `String`, arrays, objects, etc.  

5. **Variable Naming Conventions**  
   - Variable names should be descriptive and follow camelCase convention.  
   - They cannot start with a number and should not contain spaces or special characters (except for underscores).  

Reflections

Today, I realized the importance of variables in programming. They are fundamental to storing and manipulating data.
I practiced creating and using variables in small programs, which helped reinforce my understanding.


Next Steps
In the coming days, I plan to explore:
Different data types in more detail.
Variable scope and lifetime.
Constants in Java.
